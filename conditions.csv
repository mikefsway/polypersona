"Imagine you consider renting a newly constructed apartment rented out by the Better Living Real Estate Group. Right now, this is your only available option. You have therefore decided to take it and signed the contract. Better Living has a programme that supports your move to the new apartment and is asking you to fill out an online form in which you choose amenities for your new home. Before you fill out the form you come across some recent headlines from news websites that could be relevant in this situation. Please read these headlines carefully: ‘Award Winners: Affordable high-quality housing and community project by Better Living wins the 2021 American Residential Real Estate’; ‘More transparency in real estate: Memorandum passed to combat corruption in U.S. housing sector’; ‘Buyers, Notice: Report shows real estate sector can be trusted’; ‘The rise of the housing market: What everyone gets wrong about housing in the U.S. Today, most public housing developments do, in fact, deliver on their promise of providing adequate, affordable housing to people in need, but they remain stigmatised because of the negative associations with distressed public housing’; ‘Americans deserve not just better, but the best: Administration is seeking largest ever investment in building resilient, quality houses’. Consider how interesting you perceive each article to be for your situation. Now read this letter from Better Living Real Estate Group: ‘Dear tenant, We are glad that you chose to rent with us. We want to make moving in to your new apartment as easy and satisfying as possible for you. We have therefore preinstalled the following amenities in your new home. They are standard amenities, but if you want we can replace them with energy-efficient alternatives. Compared to the standard amenities, the energy-efficient amenities cost more, but due to the savings on the electricity bill, the operating costs are lower. We estimate that the energy-efficient amenities save the equivalent of the initial higher costs in about three years. If you want to keep the standard amenities, you do not need to do anything. If you want us to replace one or more with energy-efficient alternatives, you can let us know.’ The appliances are as follows: freezer; refrigerator; washing machine; electric oven and stove; air conditioner.",0.25,"Respond in JSON format.

The next object should be a short explanation (<50 word) explanation of your reasoning for your response to the Better Living Real Estate Group letter, called 'explanation', drawing on your demographic, attitudinal, and personality characteristics, and bearing in mind the headlines. Then, considering each amenity separately, output your decision on whether you would like the standard or efficient version, in JSON objects called ‘freezer’; ‘refrigerator’; ‘washing machine’; ‘electric oven and stove’; and ‘air conditioner’,  with response options efficient=1 or standard=0 (return an integer).
