"Imagine that you receive the following letter from your current electricity supplier. Dear customer, We are working in partnership with LocalEnergy, a new local energy company. You are currently enrolled on our single-provider service. This means that all your electricity will continue to be provided by us. Alternatively, you can switch to the new combined-provider service, which is offered in partnership with LocalEnergy. Customers of the combined-provider service will get most of their electricity from locally produced, renewable sources, such as solar and wind farms. If there is not enough local energy to cover your needs, we will act as a back-up, so that you will always have the power you need. The price of each service will be the same as your current tariff. If you would like to stay with the single-provider service, you do not need to do anything. If you would rather change to the combined-provider service, you need to go to our website, log in to your account, and check a box indicating that you would like to switch. It will take a few days to switch. You can switch back at any time. What would you choose to do in this scenario? Stay with the single-provider service, or switch to the combined-provider service.",1,"Respond in JSON format. The first JSON object should be a short (<50 word) explanation of your reasoning, called 'explanation', drawing on your demographic, attitudinal, and personality characteristics. Then, output your decision on whether you would choose the single or combined provider option, in a JSON object called 'decision', with response options combined=1 or single=0 (return an integer). Your decision must be consistent with your explanation. Example output as follows: 'explanation': 'explanation text here', 'decision': integer",1
