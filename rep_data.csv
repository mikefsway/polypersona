Dear customer, We are working in partnership with LocalEnergy, a new local energy company. You now have the choice of two services: 1) Single-provider: This means that all your electricity will be provided by us. 2) Combined-provider: This service is offered in partnership with LocalEnergy. Customers of the combined-provider service will get most of their electricity from locally produced, renewable sources, such as solar and wind farms. If there is not enough local energy to cover your needs, we will act as a back-up, so that you will always have the power you need. The price of each service will be the same as your current tariff. You need to go to our website, log in to your account, and check a box indicating which service you would like to choose. You can switch at any time. Which service would you choose in this scenario?
